# ExData_Plotting1

This repository is for the first course project of the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis course.

The goal was to reconstruct the four given plots using the base plotting system in order to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.

## Contents

This repository contains:

1. `CookBook.md`, which describes the data and transformations performed on the data.
2. `plot1.R`, which creates `Plot 1` in the assignment.
3. `plot1.png`, the output of `plot1.R`.
3. `plot2.R`, which creates `Plot 2` in the assignment.
4. `plot2.png`, the output of `plot2.R`.
4. `plot3.R`, which creates `Plot 3` in the assignment.
5. `plot3.png`, the output of `plot3.R`.
5. `plot4.R`, which creates `Plot 4` in the assignment.
6. `plot4.png`, the output of `plot4.R`.
